# ANALYSIS-OF-SUICIDE-IN-INDIA-WHO-WHY-AND-HOW-
Abstract:

Worldwide, suicide rate is considered one of the most significant issue. With each passing year, the number of suicide is getting increased phenomenally and because of this reason, this research is carried out to predict the causes of suicide in India by using the machine learning algorithms and data mining techniques in order to identify the root causes behind the suicide so that the authorities can take advantage in order to prevent the suicide cases by creating awareness and by rectifying the predicted causes of suicides. According to a research, about 800,000 people commit suicide worldwide every year. Out of these, 135,000 (17%) are residents of India, a nation with 17.5% of world population. In this research, we have analyzed the pattern of suicide cases and predict the causes of future suicides by using machine learning algorithms, the Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine

A study is presented at analyzing the major factors that affect the number of suicides in different parts of India from year 2000 to 2012 and subsequently using them to predict the number of suicides in the future in different parts of India. By analyzing the data and predicting the major causes of suicides it can help government to know which part of population is most affected by this problem so that government can take the required steps to reduce them. The Indian government keeps the database of each suicides that happens in India. Along with the age-group, cause of death, state of victim. This data was made public by crime branch bureau of the data analytics purpose. Relationship will be made between the different features of suicide so that a linear relationship can be formed and then linear regression will be used to develop a model for the prediction of number of suicides in rear future. Through this study the Indian government will come to know that which part of population is most affected by suicides so that government can work on preventive measures for different parts of the country.
